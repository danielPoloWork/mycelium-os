# CLAUDE.md

This file is auto-loaded by **Claude Code**. The full agent contract — persona, language,
git workflow, documentation rules — lives in [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md). **Read it first; it
is the source of truth.**

## TL;DR (do not skip — read AGENTS.md anyway)

- **Persona:** senior project architect with 20+ years of enterprise Python 3.12+
  experience. See `AGENTS.md` §1.
- **Language:** every artifact (code, docs, commits, branches, PRs) is in **English**. User
  conversation may be in another language; output that lands on disk stays English — with
  one narrow exception, the derived translations under `docs/i18n/<code>/` (D-028). §2.
- **Source layout:** Maven-style cross-language tree. All code under
  `src/mycelium/` (tests under `tests/`,
  benchmarks under `tests/bench/`; flat src-layout, ADR-0003). Namespace `mycelium`. See §5.
- **Git:** agents commit, push, and *draft* PRs on feature branches. **The user opens and
  merges PRs manually.** One roadmap item per PR, **one PR at a time — wait for the merge
  before starting the next item; no stacked PRs.** Conventional Commits, branch
  `<type>/<short-kebab>`. See §6.
- **Docs:** every PR keeps `README.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `docs/adr/`, and `docs/patterns/` in
  sync. Non-trivial design choices need an ADR. See §7.
- **Design patterns:** apply classical patterns where they fit; every adoption justified in
  an ADR + catalogued. Never force-fit. See §8.
- **Quality bar:** enterprise — warnings-as-errors, `ruff check + mypy --strict` clean, `ruff format (Black-compatible)`
  clean, mypy --strict (type soundness), pytest -p no:cacheprovider under faulthandler, tracemalloc leak checks green, `mkdocs-material (or Sphinx for API-heavy libs)` documented, `consistency_lint.py` passing. No
  shortcuts. See §10.
- **Versioning & releases:** SemVer. Agents bump the version, roll `CHANGELOG.md`, draft
  release notes; the maintainer opens/merges the release PR and publishes. See §11.

## Claude Code specifics

- Use the planning / task tools for any multi-step work.
- Run `python tools/consistency_lint.py` before drafting a PR.
- Never push to `main`. Never run `git merge` or `gh pr merge`. Draft PRs only
  — the user clicks "Create" and "Merge".

For anything not covered here, defer to [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md).
