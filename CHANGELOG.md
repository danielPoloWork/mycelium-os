# Changelog

All notable changes to `mycelium-os` are documented here, following
[Keep a Changelog 1.1.0](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and
[Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/).

Every PR that introduces a user-visible change adds a line to `[Unreleased]` in the same
PR. A release PR moves the `[Unreleased]` entries into a new per-version file under
`docs/changelog/v<MAJOR>/v<X.Y.Z>.md` and adds an index row below.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **The docs site** (roadmap 6.2, ADR-0115): a built, `--strict`-checked mkdocs-material
  site under `docs-site/` — a tutorial (install to a cited MCP answer inside spec NFR-4's
  ten-minute budget), four task-oriented how-to guides, the plugin-author guide, and a
  generated API reference over `mycelium.sdk` from its own docstrings. Canonical content
  (the spec, the ADRs, the pattern catalogue, `docs/compatibility.md`) is linked to, not
  duplicated. Build it locally with `uv run mkdocs serve`.
- **The plugin cookiecutter** (`tools/cookiecutter-mycelium-plugin`, roadmap 6.2): generates
  a complete, installable `Connector`, `Parser` or `Module` plugin — entry point wired to
  the right group, a minimal-but-correct implementation, a conformance test, a rendered
  Apache-2.0 `LICENSE` — after checking the plugin id against spec 05 §4.4's naming rule.
  Every kind is checked by rendering it and running this repository's own `ruff`,
  `ruff format --check`, `mypy --strict` and pytest against the output
  (`tests/test_plugin_cookiecutter.py`). `Synthesizer` is deliberately not offered: there
  is no entry-point resolution path to a third-party synthesizer today, stated in the
  plugin-author guide rather than left for a reader to discover the hard way.
- **The compatibility suite for the five stable contracts** (roadmap 6.1, ADR-0114).
  `tests/test_contracts.py` holds the identity rules, the KIR schema, the snapshot manifest
  schema, the MCP tool contracts and the plugin protocols to committed goldens of their
  *shape* under `tests/fixtures/contracts/` — every schema keyword that constrains, no
  description — and loads the manifest and KIR document a v0.5.0 build wrote with today's
  readers. `python tools/update_contract_goldens.py` re-blesses a golden, as part of the RFC
  and the migration note a contract change now requires. The promise the goldens back —
  what is stable, from which version, and how a change to it is made — is published as
  [`docs/compatibility.md`](docs/compatibility.md); it binds at the v1.0.0 tag.
- **Every MCP tool declares an `outputSchema`** in `tools/list`, beside the `inputSchema` it
  always had (MCP 2025-06-18 and later; older clients ignore the key), so the shape an
  agent depends on is a declared contract rather than a habit of four handlers. The fields
  an error result may carry are declared per code (`mycelium.mcp.errors.ERROR_FIELDS`), and
  a code cannot carry one it does not declare.
